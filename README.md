# ruu - Are you you?

Proof of humanity for video and audio calls.  

This proof of concept tool is being created to address the use of deepfakes as part of a video or audio call to ensure the participants are human and recognized as being part of a previously authenticated group.

Background:  In February 2024 a financial analyst transferred $25 Million to a destination having been requested to move the funds during a video call where a deepfake of the Chief Financial Officer and others was used to fool the analyst.

Concept:  Participants complete real-world action requests made through a secure authenticated channel to thwart being fooled by real-time deepfakes. Previously, in-band real-world actions were sufficient to prevent masquerades that were using pre-recorded videos.   Participants would be asked to prove they were "alive" by completing a simple task during a video conference.  For example, a request to "touch their head", will prove that the participant was not using a pre-recorded video.  The evolution of real-time deepfake technology renders this safeguard useless.

However, by using a secure channel that provides confidentiality and authentication with previously authenticated participants to pass the action request signficantly strengthens the safeguard of requesting participants perform an action.  Using a secure out-of-band channel seperate from the video conference channel allows for real-time requests for action injections to be made with greater confidence to thwart masquerading.  If the person on the video completes the task, one can have confidence that they are indeed human and part of the previously authenticated group.
